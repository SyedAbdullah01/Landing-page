# Landing-page
This is a simple landing page project. I made it for practice as it was instructed in the odin project. I have mainly used Flex box for styling different elements in this project.

Following are the different secitons of the landing page.

## Nav-Bar
It contains a logo on the left and some links on the right side of the navbar.

## Hero 
It has some text on the left side with a sign up button and an image place holder on the right.

## Info 
This is an information section that has some testimonials with images and text. The images adn text is centered in the page.

## Quote
Then we have a quote secton. Nothing much here, just some italic text with a background color.

## CTA
This is a call to action card with text on left and a sign up button on the right side. 

## Footer
Last but not the least Here we have the footer with copyright text centered.
